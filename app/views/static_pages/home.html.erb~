  <p>
  StalBIAS is a tool to calculate seasonal variations in stalagmite growth rates. 
  Stalagmites are frequently used as climate archives. A reliable decoding of the recorded
  climate signal depends on knowledge of cave processes. Cave monitoring results have shown
  that cave environments vary by seasonally or at lower periods.
  StalBIAS uses standard cave monitoring parameters to calculate growth rates. The parameters
  are Temperature, cave atmosphere CO2 concentration, drip water Calcium concentration and 
  drip rate. The calculated growth rates are estimated for the time period between two cave 
  monitoring trips.
  The StalBIAS output is the temporal variation in growth rate and the seasonal growth rate
  ratio, which represents the proportion of summer and winter growth.
